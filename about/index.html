        <h3>Brianna Mercado is a animation game art major at Umass Dartmouth:</h3>
        <p class="school">
            I started my professional journey in 2017 when I applied to Mount Ida College. After my first year 
            I transferred to Umass Dartmouth and graduating in 2021. I have a few worthy pieces; 
            I am confident in my skill to create characters in the 2d and 3d scene. I also have skills
            in a few coding disciplines such as HTML and C#. I hopefully want to become a generalist at a studio
        </p>
        <p class="life">
            I am currently based in Gloucester Massachusetts. I enjoy videogames, pets, art, and coding.
            My dream is to one day work on a large project with lots of people and produce an amazing product that 
            people will love to see or play. Even now I love to work with others and create something that they will
            love to show off. I hope to work with more people and make something wonderful!
